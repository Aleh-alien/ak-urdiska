<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>By 2012, Social Media has firmly entrenched itself in Taiwanese everyday life, with Facebook alone claiming 75% of online users. However, netizens remained pessimistic about the potential of online civic empowerment — or even engagement. The writer Chang Ta-Chuen captured this sense of disconnect in an <a href="http://techorange.com/2013/06/03/interview-with-chang-ta-chuen/">interview</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Do you see Facebook as an instrument to encourage civic engagement?</p>
<p>Chang: No, I can most definitely say, absolutely not. It makes citizens feel <em>as if</em> they have participated. […] I still can’t see how an actual, practical activism can succeed at engaging people, as lazy as we are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to blogger TH Schee’s <a href="http://blog.schee.info/2012/04/02/mobilization/">analysis</a>, the problems were five-fold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Media presence of NPOs was ineffective and often reactive</li>
<li>Individuals felt powerless to influence policies</li>
<li>Online participation could not translate into offline action</li>
<li>Open-source communities cared little for social issues</li>
<li>Generation gap prevented offline and online activists from collaborating</li>
</ol>
<p>In this article we present <a href="http://g0v.tw/">g0v.tw</a>, a civic movement by informed netizens toward participatory self-government. Born out of frustration at the government’s blithe lack of transparency at the end of 2012, in one year we have made these ongoing contributions:</p>
<ol>
<li>By establishing participatory media channels such as News Helper (Q3.3) and Congress Matters (Q4.1), we work with traditional media on equal terms (Q4.2).</li>
<li>By crowd-producing definitive works such as dictionaries (Q1.2), welfare directories (Q2.1) and contemporary history (Q2.3), we transform ourselves from passive consumers (Q0.2) into effective agents.</li>
<li>By organizing regular hackathons (Q0.3) and offering logistic support to social movements (Q3.2), we create a shared cultural space (Q4.3) that blends online and offline activism.</li>
<li>By constructing sites of social production modeled after open-source principles (Q1.1), we shape civic projects into communal grounds for learning and hacking alike (Q2.2).</li>
<li>By designing outreach programs on social issues such as labor rights (Q1.3), we form ongoing dialogues with established activists, promoting social awareness and online consensus-building (Q3.1).</li>
</ol>
<p>The unifying idea behind our contributions is a simple one:
Taking a <em>hands-on</em>, <em>open-source</em> and <em>public-spirited</em> approach, we combine best practices from Free Software, Civic Media and Social Activism into an active community around Information Transparency.</p>

<h1>Background: Winter of 2012</h1>
<h2>The “Real Price” Incident [Q0.1]</h2>
<p>Amidst popular unrest regarding speculative housing inflation, President Ma Ying-Jiu made <em>housing justice</em> a key component of his 2012 re-election platform. In an attempt to counter speculation and enable fair taxation, the parliament passed a bipartisan bill mandating that all real estate transactions register the actual price.</p>
<p>As part of the mandate, the Ministry of the Interior commissioned a website on which people can find transaction records by street address. The site went live on October 16 to a flood of requests and remained only intermittently accessible for most of October.</p>
<p>Three days after the launch, a team of four Google.tw engineers incorporated the Ministry’s data into their “Real-Price Maps” website, overlaying aggregated pricing information on Google Maps with a plethora of filtering features. Their remix was an instant success, serving hundreds of requests per second from Google App Engine without a hitch.</p>
<p>A week later, Minister without portfolio Zhang Shan-Zheng (a Google alum himself) invited the remixers to a round table. The team responded amiably, offering <a href="http://goo.gl/r2082">detailed suggestions</a> about how they would like to collaborate with the government.</p>
<p>However, after sensational media coverage pitted the team’s shoestring budget of NTD$500 against the official site’s “million-dollar disaster”, the relationship between the two soon turned sour. The Ministry used the crawling activity as a convenient excuse for their own server’s downtime, while critics questioned the legality of scraping and remixing government data.</p>
<p>The incident came to a head on November 14, when the official site replaced all street addresses with image files, dramatically increasing the burden of crawling. While a skilled hacker eventually published parsed data using OCR techniques, it is clear that the attrition is of no benefit to anyone. The Real-Price Maps site closed shortly thereafter.</p>
<h2>“Power-Up Plan for the Economy” [Q0.2]</h2>
<p>While the Real Price incident was still unfolding, a new government production took the spotlight: A 40-seconds propaganda video titled “What's the Economy Power-Up Plan?”</p>
<p>Entirely devoid of information, the clip simply repeated the following monotonous refrain: “We have a very complex plan. It is too complicated to explain. Never mind the details — just follow instructions and go along with it!”</p>
<p>Met with widespread incredulity and mockery, the video went viral as viewers on YouTube rushed to click “report abuse” in protest. The automated system quickly classified the video as scam and banned the government's YouTube account for two days.</p>
<p>The video went on-air again on October 19, just before Yahoo Open Hack Day 2012, an annual 24-hour event in which sixty-four teams show off their innovative creations. Infuriated by the controversial ad, the four members of the “Hacker #15” team made a last-minute pivot from their “online window shopping” project. Rather than displaying merchandises, they resolved to create a bird’s eye view of how taxes are spent.</p>
<p>The resulting “Budget Maps” presented each agency’s annual spending in the form of geometric shapes of proportional sizes, inviting participants to review and rate each item’s usefulness. Calling upon citizens to “strike out rip-off spending (e.g. the Power-Up ad)”, the two-minute demo won NTD$50K in Hack Day prizes.</p>
<p>While demo day crowds are known to quickly forget such projects, team member CL Kao came up with an elegant hack to keep this one alive. He registered the catchy domain name <strong>g0v.tw</strong>, dedicated to citizens’ remixes of government websites. The Real-Price Maps thus became accessible at <strong>lvr.land.moi.g0v.tw</strong> — literally just one fingertip away from its official counterpart at <strong>lvr.land.moi.gov.tw</strong>; meanwhile, the Budget Maps lived on at <strong>budget.g0v.tw</strong> as the inaugural g0v.tw project.</p>
<h2>Hackath0n [Q0.3]</h2>
<p>Equipped with the new g0v.tw domain, the four hackers agreed to spend the NTD$50k prize on their own Hackathon to enlist more projects into this newfangled syndicate of civic remixes. Modeled after participant-driven “BarCamp” events, they named the event “0th Hackathon of Martial Mobilization”, invoking a rebellious image from the 1949-era civil war.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic registrants soon exceeded the initial venue’s capacity. Fortunately, a lab director at Academia Sinica offered to host the event at the Institute of Information Science. On December 1, civic hackers filled the institute’s 80-person auditorium and presented their projects, covering a wide range of government functions, including Congress, Tenders, Geography, Weather, Electricity, Healthcare and many other areas. Lively discussion continued online at <a href="http://g0v.hackpad.com/">Hackpad</a> and <a href="http://hack.g0v.tw/irc">IRC</a> well after the daylong event.</p>
<p>In support of the coding efforts, writers and bloggers formed a Facebook group “copywriting on demand”, offering their skills to any project that asked for assistance. Designer Even Wu also initiated a “design on demand” group, providing hackers with various visual assets.</p>
<p>Dissatisfied with the makeshift logo banner, Wu would continue to work on several iterations of the logotypes, eventually completing a set of Visual Identity guidelines, which elevated g0v into an easily recognizable brand.</p>
<p><img src="https://dchtm6r471mui.cloudfront.net/hackpad.com_hmHV14IhfO2_p.41199_1388875869670_g0v-logos.jpg" alt="illus. 2: Evolution of logotype designs" /></p>
<h1>2013 Q1</h1>
<h2>Hacking Infrastructures [Q1.1]</h2>
<p>As the new projects continue online, writers and designers participating in g0v found that Facebook groups lacked essential features such as shared bookmarks and task tracking. On the other hand, popular tools for open-source software development such as Git, IRC and Wikis posed a high entry barrier for non-coder participants.</p>
<p>To address this issue, in January 2013, we launched <strong>hack.g0v.tw</strong> as the common entry point for online projects as well as face-to-face events. It combines several tools that form a cohesive space for coordination:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hackfoldr</strong> organizes all related links around a project into multi-level bookmarks.</li>
<li><strong>EtherCalc</strong> provides a scalable, multi-user spreadsheet with an API tailored to the needs of Hackfoldr.</li>
<li><strong>People Registry</strong> lets participants discover each other with profile tags for projects, issues, skills and interests.</li>
<li><strong>Project Registry</strong> lists the contact information for each project, as well as bite-sized tasks for new contributors.</li>
<li><strong>Web Chat</strong> keeps daily logs with a distinct URL for each line, and introduces new users to IRC via web-based chatrooms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Owing to the diverse nature of the projects and participants, there’s a strong preference for lightweight, descriptive structures (“tags”) over rigid, prescriptive structures (“taxonomies”).</p>
<p>Because much of our activities are face-to-face, we also favor real-time shared documents (e.g., Hackpad and EtherCalc) over revision-controlled, long distance collaboration tools (e.g., Wikis and mailing lists).</p>
<h2>Reclaiming Our Language [Q1.2]</h2>
<p>The resounding success for the December 2012 gathering prompted a successive event. The “1st Hackathon of Homesteading Commons” was held on January 27 at three cities across Taiwan, attracting one hundred on-site hackers and even more online participants.
</p>
<p>One of the online participants was Ping Yeh, a long-time open source advocate who immigrated to the US in 2011. In a blog article posted the night before the Hackathon, he called upon g0v hackers to liberate the <em>Revised Ministry of Education Dictionary</em> from the Ministry’s archaic website into “an open API, with full index and search capabilities, free for all individuals and companies to use.”
</p>
<p>
With over 160 thousand entries, rich etymologies, and full references to classical texts, the <em>MoE Dictionary</em> has been the authoritative definition of the Traditional Chinese language since it was first published in 1945. The digital-only <em>Revised</em> edition launched in 1996 as a website and attracted nearly 200 million visits—even with almost no upgrades—over the next seventeen years.
</p>
<p>
What would it take to bring the <em>Revised MoE</em> into the modern web of permanent URLs, Unicode text, and mobile devices? Yeh argued that the Ministry of Education ought to provide unencumbered dictionary data and let citizens take care of the presentation. Since the Ministry took the opposite stance by explicitly disallowing redistribution, Yeh pledged to personally design the required data structure so civic hackers could scrape the dictionary data to “reclaim our language.”
</p>
<p>
More than 30 participants on the <em>MoeDict</em> team—formed during the Hackathon—worked overnight. The next day, the team published not only complete data in JSON and SQL formats, but also prototyped websites and apps for all major platforms. With the recent memory of Real Price Map’s closure, we forestalled copyright issues with two legal devices:
</p>
<ol>
<li>By claiming Fair Use of government-produced data under Article 50 of Taiwan’s Copyright Act, we took a non-infringing position by adhering to strict not-for-profit principles.</li>
<li>By disclaiming all property rights using the CC0 public domain declaration, we made sure the Ministry of Education could incorporate all our contributions at any time.</li>
</ol>
<p>
After months of deliberation, the Ministry eventually agreed to our fair use claim and collaborated with us to convert their CC-licensed Taiwanese Holo & Hakka dictionaries into a cross-referenced, multilingual platform at <a href="https://www.moedict.tw">moedict.tw</a>. The website would go on to serve millions of visits per month, with over 100 thousand regular mobile app users by the end of 2013.
</p>
<h2>Job Helper [Q1.3]</h2>
<p>It is important to job seekers to know whether an employer has followed employment laws and regulations while hiring employees. This is why <a href="http://jobhelper.g0v.ronny.tw/">Job Helper</a> was launched.
</p>
<p>
Since June 2011, when the Labor Standards Law amendments were passed, any violations of the Law by an employer would be made public through the Labor Affairs Bureau of each county and city. However, before job applicants can get the information, they need to find in which county or city the company is registered, and then dive in a long search for related documents in various file formats stored somewhere on the official website of the Bureau. Adding to this daunting task is that many people are not aware that this kind of information is regularly published by the Labor Affairs Bureaus despite its importance to job seekers.
</p>
<p>
In January 2013, when hTC cancelled overtime wages for its employees, Ronny Wang, motivated by how poorly the employers were treated by corporations, proposed the project <em>Job Helper</em>. “If we could identify whether or not an employer has violated the Labor Standards Law as we seek for jobs,” said Wang, “we would be more alert about the risks of the job and would have a better sense about the reasonable wages.”
</p>
<p>
During development, the first problem encountered was the absence of information about violations on all popular job search websites. The solution was to create and utilize an extension program to the browsers. Now users can install <em>Job Helper</em>, a browser extension, from the Chrome Web Store. This extension can check employers listed on the job search websites and identify an employer with a history of violations. The information on these violations will then pop out when you browse the job opportunities posted by the employer.
</p>
<p>
How are these violation data accessed and collected? This work can only rely on data crawling. Ronny Wang and Guo-Wei Su analyzed various electronic documents of lists of employers violating the Labor Standards Law provided by Labor Affairs Bureaus of all the counties and cities in Taiwan, and wrote a program which automatically imports the information in the documents into database records with a uniform format.
</p>
<p>
Enormous efforts have been devoted to the project so far, and the result has turned out to be a huge success. To date, Job Helper has 34k users, and supports several popular job search websites in Taiwan, including 104, 1111, yes123, 518, and ejob. It is rated 4.88 stars out of 5 at Chrome Web Store.

<h1>2013 Q2</h1>
<h2>Listening to Welfare [Q2.1]</h2>

<p>
Blue Chen, a hearing impaired web engineer, was inspired by clkao's g0v talk at webconf.tw 2013.  Being troubled by the convoluted welfare regulations himself, which differ from county to county, he initiated a project that aggregates criteria for welfare program provided by local governments and NGOs.
</p>
<p>
<em>[<a href="http://listening.g0v.tw/">The project</a> soon attracted many helpful hands ...]</em>
</p>

<h2>Open Source Developers’ Conference [Q2.2]</h2>
<h2>From Anger to Fact [Q2.3]</h2>

<p>
Say you discover a fine website that provides a detailed history of certain events, but later find that its resourcefulness is merely a façade, the purpose of which is to justify the wrongness of the activities of wealthy corporations. Such stories told may be beautiful, but they are only single-sided, muting voices from other sources. The façade hides the harmful actions done to the lands we live on that care little about our traditional cultures. If you are a web programmer, what would you do besides despising the corporations and mourning for our society?
</p>
<p>
The idea behind the website <a href="http://fact.g0v.tw/"><b>fact.g0v.tw</b></a> is to simplify complicated information and present highlighted events in timelines. It is to be compared with the “consortium's version”, offering the public more chances to discover the truth.
</p>
<p>
<b>Fact</b> (政誌) had previously been codenamed <b>Angry Politics</b> (怒政), named after our anger aimed at today’s political affairs. We soon found that the Angry image was less appealing to the public in the long term, so the members came up with a better name, <em>Fact</em> (政誌, “Political diary”), which is a homophone of “politics” (政治) in Mandarin.
</p>
<p>
With this “diary”, we hope that people will remember their history wherein our efforts and passion are devoted to fighting for the right. No matter the results, a lot of things are still in progress and deserve continuous attention.
</p>
<p>
The data on <em>Fact</em> are collected from Wikipedia and rearranged. In addition to keeping historical data, the site reflects the editable data on Wikipedia and, in this sense, allows the public to take part in <em>Fact</em> in recording history.
</p>
<p>
To date, there are more than 21 g0v members involved in program development and homepage editing for <em>Fact</em>, and its contents are contributed by numerous Wikipedia writers. Hot topics on <em>Fact</em> include several important events in Taiwan, such as same-sex marriage, the September political conflicts, Da-Tung oil, the White Shirt Army social movement, the Da-Pu event, the referendum on Taiwan's Fourth Nuclear Plant, the Sun-Moon-Light wastewater, toxic starch, etc.
</p>
<p>
While most events are still taking place, they seem winding down due to the short memories of the media and the public. <em>Fact</em> needs the general public as well as the engineers to run properly, because it requires both hard data and reliable narrations stored in the people's minds to be pulled out, published, and recorded in Wikipedia, so that we shall never lose track of everything that has happened in Taiwan.
